# ED-Control-Noodling
Noodling around with some (built-in) Elite Dangerous features to try to figure out how to make a smart control binding app.

## Installation
The `DeviceMappings.xml` and `ThrustMasterHOTASViper.binds` files go into `%SteamLibrary%\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\Products\elite-dangerous-odyssey-64\ControlSchemes`.

The files in the `DeviceButtonMaps` folder go into the `DeviceButtonMaps` folder inside that `ControlSchemes` folder.

Everything is very much still a work in progress (although it might turn into a lot of nothing).

## TODO
A Preset name seems to be a human-friendly name pointing to Binds XML file. How do I make a Preset name with spaces in it?
